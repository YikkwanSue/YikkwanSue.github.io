    <h2>Website Design Concept</h2>

    <p>I chose Video Art as the theme of this assignment. The entire website is mainly simple and clear. Because the video pattern is too complex, I want to simplify the design of the entire web page so that the video will not steal the focus or make the web page cluttered. 
    <br><br>The color of the top button bar will change when it is moved. Selecting different buttons will go to different websites (window.open), and when typing "yes I do" in the lower right corner, you will go to YouTube. 
    The most difficult interaction on the entire website is boucing ball. I watched a lot of YouTube videos and other people's coding on github, but it couldn't be directly substituted into my file and required a lot of adjustments.</p>
    Crafting a seamless bouncing ball animation is challenging due to the intricacies involved in managing spatial dynamics, synchronization, and coordinate transformations within the codebase.
    For instance, how to set the Ball properties.
    <br> <br>
    On the left button, there's a logo; upon clicking it, sound effects will play. I use the logo in design last year for the test, try which coding style is more suitable.
    <br><p>Click <a href="logotest/index.html">here</a> to go to Logo Test</p>
    But since I already learn how to use Java Script, I put 
    <br>"var singLogo = document.getElementById('sing-logo');
    <br>singLogo.addEventListener('mouseover', function() {
      <br> singLogo.src = 'sing2.png';
    });" instead
