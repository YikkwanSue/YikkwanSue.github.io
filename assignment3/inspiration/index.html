    <h2>Website Design Concept</h2>

    <p>The bakery theme was chosen to bring warmth and delight to the coding interaction website. 
    Bakeries evoke comfort and satisfaction, helping users feel at ease. The design uses warm colors like browns, creams, and pastels, reminiscent of baked goods, to create an inviting atmosphere.
    <h2>User Experience and Interactivityt</h2>
    Hover Effects: When users hover over different elements, subtle animations or changes in color provide feedback, 
    making the experience more dynamic.
    <p>Animation: A playful dog icon is keep bouncing, to add a dynamic and lively element to the site. This small, whimsical touch captures attention and adds personality, making the site more engaging.
    </p>
    <p>Typing Effect:To prevent the site from feeling static or monotonous, a typing effect is incorporated for text elements. This effect simulates real-time typing, making content delivery more engaging and visually appealing.</p>

    When users move their mouse over text or items, a yellow dot appears, guiding them by indicating their selection. This interactive navigation aid enhances usability, making the site more intuitive and user-friendly.

  <p>In reflecting on the interactive design process, I recognize an area where significant improvement is needed: the execution of wireframes. Initially, I struggled to create wireframes that precisely matched my draft concepts. 
  <br>This inconsistency became evident in the design of the product table, which deviated from the original draft.
  <br>for example the product table, it is not match with my draft
